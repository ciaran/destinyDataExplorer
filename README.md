# Destiny Data Explorer

Work in progress.

To run locally you will need:

- Node v14.x.x (see .nvmrc)
- Yarn 1.3.2

If you do not run these specific versions, you may get errors installing and running for whatever reason.

Use a node version manager to use a specific node version.
You can use corepack to use a specific version of yarn - `corepack prepare yarn@1.3.2 --activate`
